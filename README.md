# Project-Vision
Postman collections for DellEMC's block storage products
## Details
This Avengers' project leverages Postman's import collection capabilities to provide sample API calls for the following products:
 - PowerMax
 - XtremIO
 - Unity
 - VxFlex (formerly ScaleIO)

The next release of Project Vision will also include a collection for SC (formerly Compellent)

The goal of the project is to help customers of these products to automate day 1 and day 2 operations by looking at handy examples. API reference guides can sometimes be many hundreds of pages, so by looking at some of the most common operational examples one can kickstart coding efforts. Each collection aims to provide sample calls in these areas:
 - Gather system and hardware information
 - Basic provisioning
 - Performance and event collection

Every API call in these collections has been provided with a sample reply so that developers can more easily see what fields are relevant for their purpose and help fast tracking the coding effort
